Since you're ready to implement this, here is a new, revised prompt for the Replit AI to pivot your design.
"Hello! I've decided to update my platform's design to follow the standard YouTube layout for both mobile and desktop. Please help me refactor my video experience.
The goal is to have a main video player at the top of the screen with a scrollable content area below it for the video description, creator info, and comments.
Here are the new requirements:
1. Refactor the Main Video "Watch" Page
This will be the core page where users watch content.
 * Layout (CSS/HTML):
   * Create a two-part layout for the mobile view:
     * A top container (<div class="video-player-wrapper">) that will hold the video. This container should have a 16:9 aspect ratio and stick to the top.
     * A bottom container (<div class="content-wrapper">) that is scrollable and will hold the title, description, and comments.
   * Inside .video-player-wrapper, the <video> element should be styled with width: 100%; height: 100%;.
 * Video Handling Logic (CSS/JavaScript):
   * The video element should still use the data-aspect-ratio attribute ('portrait' or 'landscape').
   * For a landscape video (data-aspect-ratio="landscape"), use object-fit: cover; to ensure it fills the 16:9 player wrapper completely.
   * For a portrait video (data-aspect-ratio="portrait"), use object-fit: contain; and background-color: black;. This will center the vertical video within the horizontal player, creating the "pillarbox" effect.
2. Implement an "Immersive Mode" for Vertical Videos
 * HTML: In the video player's controls, add a "fullscreen/expand" button.
 * JavaScript:
   * When the video loads, check its data-aspect-ratio.
   * Add a click listener to the fullscreen button.
   * If the video's aspect ratio is 'portrait', the button click should add a class like is-immersive to the main page container.
 * CSS:
   * The .is-immersive .video-player-wrapper should be styled with position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100vw; height: 100vh; z-index: 9999;.
   * The .is-immersive .content-wrapper should be hidden (display: none;).
   * This will make the player take over the entire screen, providing an immersive 9:16 experience. Clicking a close button or pressing 'escape' should remove the class and return to the standard view.
3. Refactor the Feed Page
The feed should now be a list of video thumbnails, not fullscreen players.
 * Layout (CSS/HTML):
   * Change the feed items from the tall 9:16 containers to smaller "card" elements.
   * Each card should have:
     * A video thumbnail <img> at the top, styled with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
     * A content area below the thumbnail for the video title, creator's name, view count, and time since upload.
   * This should be a vertically scrollable list of cards."
